PROCESS AUTOMATION FOR LOAN DISBURSEMENT- UNITY BANK

PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project simulates the digital transformation of a loan processing system for a fictional bank (Unity Bank).
The objective is a transition from a manual, paper-based AS-IS loan process to a fully automated TO-BE digital process.

The project deliverables include:

1) Business Requirements Document (BRD)
2) Functional Requirements Document (FRD)
3) Process Diagrams (AS-IS & TO-BE)
4) Wireframes
5) Jira User Stories & Sprint Planning
6) Final Documentation Repository

KEY FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

The system implements 12 functional requirements covering the entire loan lifecycle:

1. Loan Application Submission
2. Preliminary Document Check
3. Automated Document Verification
4. e-KYC Verification
5. Manual KYC Verification
6. Credit Score Check
7. AML Check
8. Manual Credit & Risk Review
9. Bank Manager Approval
10. Digital Agreement Signing
11. Loan Disbursement
12. Notifications

Each FR includes detailed acceptance criteria and is aligned with the TO-BE process workflow.

PROCESS FLOWS

AS-IS Process (Current State)

1) Loan applications submitted manually at branches.
2)  Physical documents checked by loan officers.
3)  KYC conducted through paper-based/manual checks.
4)  Credit assessment delays due to disconnected systems.
5)  Approvals and disbursement take days/weeks.
6)  Limited customer communication and tracking.

TO-BE Process (Future State):

  1) Customers submit loan applications digitally (online/branch).
  2) Documents verified automatically using system checks.
  3) e-KYC triggered seamlessly after document verification.
  4) Automated credit score fetch and AML check via APIs.
  5) Manual review only for exceptions or failures.
  6) Bank Manager digitally approves applications.
  7) Agreements signed electronically using Aadhaar OTP/DigiLocker.
  8) Loan disbursed automatically through CBS API.
  9) Real-time customer notifications via SMS/app.

WIREFRMAES

The following wireframes were created to visualize the TO-BE system:

* Customer Details Screen
* Credit Analyst Dashboard
* Agreement Signing Screen

*(All wireframe images are included in this repository.)*


AGILE APPROACH

This project followed the Agile Scrum methodology within the SDLC framework:

1)Epics: 4 (Loan Application, KYC, Credit & Risk, Approval & Completion)
2)User Stories: 12 (aligned with the Functional Requirements)
3)Sprints: 4 planned sprints with clear goals and deliverables
4)Tools Used: Jira (user stories, backlog, sprint planning), GitHub (version control, documentation)


DOCUMENTATION

1)BRD – Defines the business requirements.
2)FRD– Defines functional and non-functional requirements.
3)Jira Stories– Captures Agile user stories with acceptance criteria.
4)Sprint Plan– Organizes delivery across 4 sprints.

OUTCOMES

1) Reduced loan processing cycle from manual, multi-day workflow → near real-time automation.
2) Enhanced customer experience with digital applications and notifications.
3) Increased efficiency by automating KYC, credit checks, and approvals.
4) Delivered a simulated end-to-end SDLC project with Agile delivery practices.
